Hi guys! My name is Danny and I am an MA Econ student. I am on the 18-month track so that I can take the practicum for data and get a little extra Python and coding help. The truth is, I have very little experience with coding and data, but I loved the few stats, coding, and impact analysis courses I have taken, which has made me want to explore and develop some experience with the tools that would help me in the job market for roles that involve these kinds of analysis. I am interested in data roles for policy analysis and private sector consulting and hope to use these valuable skills to help!
